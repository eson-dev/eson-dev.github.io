Apart from work, we are also using video calls more and more to stay in touch with friends and family.\nJoining work meetings with webcam on is becoming normal and it certainly helps with communication - facial expression, body language, nodding and other visual cues are helpful apart from voice. It is also pleasing to see the faces of co-workers whom we haven\u0026rsquo;t met in person for a long time.\nHowever, not everyone has a nice background and we also want to protect the privacy of our family members at home. Most video call applications (such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom) provide virtual backgrounds, or the ability to blur your background. Depending on your webcam and the actual environment, the effect might or might not be satisfactory.\nI decided to buy a collapsible Chromakey background (green screen) so that I can play with OBS Virtual Camera and still be able to store the green screen to save space.\nTo improve video quality, I\u0026rsquo;ve also upgraded to a Logitech Brio, and I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with the image quality. (It also comes with an attachable privacy shutter)\nFurthermore, this is also one of the few webcams which support Windows Hello Face sign in. See how it works:\n   To make use of the green screen, I use OBS Virtual Camera like most people. You can find a lot of tutorials online with details. I\u0026rsquo;ll do a quick run-down here with my personal setup.\nFirst of all, with the webcam already added as a \u0026ldquo;Video Capture Device\u0026rdquo; in OBS, simply add a \u0026ldquo;Chroma Key\u0026rdquo; filter to the camera. The green screen is visible when the filter is hidden.\n\r\r\r Next, add an image or media source (video) to the scene in OBS and they will be displayed within the chromakey area.\nHow it looks with a static image (of Singapore üá∏üá¨): For some extra fun, download a loopable short video online and let it play in loop:\n   With everything setup, simply click Start Virtual Camera under the Controls.\nBack in the video call application (Teams in this example), select \u0026ldquo;OBS Virutal Camera\u0026rdquo; instead of Logitech Brio:\n","date":1613865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613865600,"objectID":"98ddf6cc01f531eb1af5e6a50ab0efa1","permalink":"https://eson.dev/post/wfh-setup-with-virtual-camera/","publishdate":"2021-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/wfh-setup-with-virtual-camera/","section":"post","summary":"Using a green screen and OBS Virtual Camera to improve my work-from-home setup.","tags":["Tech","Work_From_Home","COVID-19"],"title":"Improving WFH Setup with OBS Virtual Camera","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Like many others, I have been working from home since March 18thdue to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, as a software developer, all my work can be done on a computer, remoting into the workstation in office. In the past, I had also worked from home occassionally so my VPN is already setup way ahead.\nI thank my past self for building a good desktop PC (mostly for gaming though üòÜ) which make the transition to fully WFH a lot more comfortable.\nMost of my \u0026ldquo;gears\u0026rdquo; were shipped from Singapore when I moved to Montreal in 2017. I self-built this PC back in 2011, it\u0026rsquo;s almost 10 years old. Over the years, I have upgraded/replaced many components except the CPU and motherboard.\n Intel Core i5-2400 CPU (Sandy Bridge) 24 GB DDR3 RAM Zotac GeForce RTX 2060 6GB GDDR6 Graphic Card Total 700 GB SSD Total 7 TB HDD EVGA 650W fully modular PSU  For the displays, I have two Dell monitors with a 24\u0026rdquo; U2417H pairing with an older 23\u0026rdquo; U2311H. Both are the UltraSharp series from Dell, using In-plane Switching (IPS) panels which make the color looks really great. I also prefer this type of stands which allow height adjustment. \nüí° Tip: Workspace ergonomics suggests that the main monitor should be placed at the center with about an arm\u0026rsquo;s length away from the body, instead of a /\\ shape.\nüí° Tip: You can use both screens for Remote Desktop by checking the \u0026ldquo;Use all my monitors for the remote session\u0026rdquo; box. To maximize space, I bought two Fitueyes Monitor Risers which not only allow me to set the monitors on eye level, but also to slot in the keyboard and mouse under it whenever I need more space.\nFor typing, I am using the Cougar 600K Mechanical Gaming Keyboard. Its simple design takes away the unnecessary gaming function keys and gets the job done. It is using Cherry MX Blue mechanical switches so there is the unavoidable clicking sound during typing. (My Logitech G710+ keyboard with less noisy MX Brown switches is still stuck in the office, unfortunately üòì)\nThe mouse and headphones are two new additions to my setup, bought during this WFH period, to replace their predecessors which were not as comfortable.\nThe Logitech G203 has a simple design and works comfortably for my hand size. The side buttons are always a must to me because they allow me to easily navigate back and forward (in browser, explorer, IDE etc.). It also has a light that changes color (configurable). \nThe Vankyo CM7000 Gaming Headset has a noise-canceling microphone that is 360¬∞ adjustable. It allows me to speak much clearly during calls. As a plus point, it can also be plugged into a PS4 controller.\n\r\nI don\u0026rsquo;t usually turn on video during work calls but I do have an Ausdom Full HD Webcam sitting on top of the Dell U2311H monitor, ready to serve when needed. It also has a built-in microphone.\n\r\nLast but not least, a very comfortable chair - the Secretlab Omega Series. Mine is the 2016 series bought in Singapore. It is made by a company founded in Singapore, and now they have expanded to Europe and North America.\n\r\nI don\u0026rsquo;t need my all-in-one Canon MX727 (seen in picture above) for work, but it is always useful when I need to scan and print documents.\nWFH is going be the \u0026ldquo;new normal\u0026rdquo; for developers like us, and I am ready.\nNow I just need a hair cut. üíá‚Äç‚ôÇ\n","date":1592611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592611200,"objectID":"c7970a923ba7650815f2226e6c29b2b6","permalink":"https://eson.dev/post/work-from-home-setup/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/work-from-home-setup/","section":"post","summary":"My setup to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.","tags":["Tech","Work_From_Home","COVID-19"],"title":"My Work From Home Setup","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve had the opportunity to attend ConFoo Montreal 2020 at Hotel Bonaventure Montr√©al this week. \r\r\nWhat is ConFoo? \rConFoo is a nonprofit organization founded by Yann Larriv√©e. In 18 years, the event has evolved from a PHP conference to include all web technologies and related topics.\nAll the topics this year are listed here and the presentation slides were uploaded by the organizer at this Github repository: https://github.com/confooca/yul2020-slides üòç\nThe Presentations The presentation on Go and Kubernetes were most related to my current job, and they were super popular with the rooms fully packed. Sadly there was only one single session on Go.\nIt was also nice to see some cool things in Python 3 since I\u0026rsquo;ve been coding using Python 2.7 for the past 3 years. Even though the chance of me switching to Python 3 at work remains low.\nFor historical reason, the conference is mostly on web technologies with a lot of them on PHP (which I didn\u0026rsquo;t attend any). Besides those, there were many talks on various JavaScript topics. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to know that we now have browser API to get battery status and connect to Bluetooth devices; you can also build an indie platformer game (like Celeste) running at 60fps and publish on Steam.\n\rFlutter from Google looks promising and I am eager to try it out. It looks like an attempt from Google to promote Dart.\nThe Swag (Stuff We All Get) Every participant get a goodie bag with some stickers and magnets in it.

You probably found this website from my LinkedIn or other social media profiles.\nWhy eson.dev? For years, I have always wanted to own a personal website. Back when I was living in Singapore, I even reserved the hostname eson.sg for many years without hosting anything üòÖ. I was still building up my career and LinkedIn is the best place to display my skills and experience.\nIn 2019, I found that .dev has become a top-level domain, as announced by Google. A quick search showed that eson.dev is still available and I purchased the domain in no time. I wanted to use it as an alternative to my LinkedIn profile and give it a more personal touch, to showcase my experience and game projects, and maybe write some articles to share some tips and tricks.\nDeciding the tech to use After owning the domain name, it was time to decide on the technology to build the site on. A long time ago, I learnt website building with just HTML and JavaScript using Microsoft FrontPage (it was also a period when Flash was prominent) üòÇ. Of course, we are living in 2020 now and there are so many ways to create your own website without even writing a single line of HTML.\nI tried out with the GitHub\u0026rsquo;s own personal-website project. It uses Jekyll as the site generator. For some reasons, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like Jekyll. Soon after that I discovered Hugo as an alternative (it\u0026rsquo;s also written in Go and I use Go every day at work) and decided to give it a try, and it fits my needs. While searching for a theme on Hugo, I found Academic and it looks fantastic!\nBy following Academic\u0026rsquo;s installation guide, I was able to setup Netlify to automatically build and deploy my changes, and the first version of my website was published in less than 10 minutes! The best of all is that I am able to use the Starter (free) tier of Netlify to host my website and tie it to my custom domain eson.dev.\nKeeping it updated Now that the Netlify pipeline has been setup, I simply have to push my changes to the Github repository, and everything will be automagically built and deployed live by Netlify in less than a minute.
